# TODO List

## Bug Fixes

[ ] fix jump target resolution for external crate functions (e.g., `resvg::render()` currently jumps to src/icons.rs).

## Features to Implement

[ ] add Open Folder button to the file explorer so users can open a folder directly from the explorer view
[ ] implement "Go to Definition" feature for function calls
[ ] improve syntax highlighting for nested generics
[ ] add support for code folding in the code windows
[ ] implement a dark mode theme for the UI
[ ] optimize performance for large files (>10,000 lines)
[ ] add keyboard shortcuts for common actions (e.g., save, open, close tab)

## Future Enhancements

[ ] implement a plugin system for extending application functionality
